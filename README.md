# React & Vite Counter apps (Zustand)

This is a simple React.js application that uses Zustand for state management. The app allows the user to increase, decrease, or reset a number. All data regarding the current state of the number is stored in local storage, ensuring that the state remains consistent even after refreshing the page.

## 📡 Tech Stack:

- [React.js](https://react.dev/) The library for web and native user interfaces. React lets you build user interfaces out of individual pieces called components. Create your own React components like Thumbnail, LikeButton, and Video. Then combine them into entire screens, pages, and apps.

- [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs/) A small, fast and scalable bearbones state-management solution using simplified flux principles. Has a comfy API based on hooks, isn't boilerplatey or opinionated.

- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) ESLint statically analyzes your code to quickly find problems. It is built into most text editors and you can run ESLint as part of your continuous integration pipeline.
